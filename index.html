    <h1>Hi! I'm Joshua Mackelprang</h1>
    <p>I am a cybersecurity analyst living in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in Thinkful's program to broaden my skills and learn how to be a software developer.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>After graduating college, I started working for a cybersecurity company as a SOC Analyst. While I do enjoy my work there, I have always wanted to learn how to be a programmer ever since my dad taught me about what he did for his job when I was little. I eventually decided to pursue my interests and start seriously learning how to code</p>
    <h3>These are some of the things I've learned how to do through programming:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Simplify code to be easier to read and more efficient</li>
      <li>Work with others to find unique and creative solutions</li>
      <li>Create stylish and functional websites</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Here are a few of my favorite things to do for fun:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing board games or video games with friends and family</li>
      <li>Going camping and seeing the night sky full of stars</li>
      <li>Read science fiction novels with my cat lying in my lap</li>
    </ul>
